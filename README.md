# LGM-TASK-1
CREATE A SINGLE PAGE WEBSITE

Hello everyone!
This is my first task of my web development internship at Letsgrowmore Community. Herein I have designed a single page tourism website named "TRAVELO", the major purpose of this website is to share information about various tourist destinations in the world along with their best features, best pricings, best tour places along their travel packages. This website works as per the demands of the user and offers best travel package for them. Along with that, it also offers our contact details in order to get immediate support whenever needed.
I explored various concepts and fundamentals of web development by designing this single page responsive website using the knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. This task helped me to enrich my knowledge and skills in web development. Meanwhile, this internship turned out to be a great part of my learning process and an add on to my practical skills by getting my hands into coding.
Also, I would like to thank Letsgrowmore community for this marvellous opportunity.
